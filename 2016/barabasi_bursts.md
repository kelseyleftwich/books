#Bursts
##Albert-Laszlo Barabasi
**5/10**
_Entertaining. Introduces interesting ideas. Fails to follow through after it piqued my interest._

###Power-law distribution
"The very essence of a power-law distribution is that it naturally predicts such rare events, telling us that we will always have a few data points that grossly deviate from the average. In other words, when power laws are present, we can always count on outliers."
_Page 102_

###The man who taught himself to swim by reading
The story of Theodor Kaluza and Albert Einstein.
- how prioritization is related to "burstiness"
- prioritization is not without its consequences
_Chapter 15_

###Science as a metaphor for life
"Science itself ofter follows a Levy pattern - a huge jump ahead trailed by many small, localized steps that appear to take us nowhere, or perhaps even backward in some instances. These are not wasted moves, however, but necessary to testing the boundaries of the new paradigm."
_Page 179_

###Applications
- Burstiness can be leveraged if we use it to break out of our comfort zones and then explore the novel terrain we find ourselves in. Even seemingly fruitless experimentation has taught us something (the boundaries and contours of our paradigm).
- Prioritization drives our burstiness. What are we prioritizing?
- Expect the unexpected.
